inline x86 assembly for dilation and erosion operations

This was my x86 assembly class project. Implementation of dilation and erosion operations in inline assembly

I have implemented the same dilation /erosion algorithm in x86 and then in C . The dilation operation in asm for 50x50 filter in 512x512 photo completes in 0.4 secs aproximately. The same operation in C++ for 50x50 filter in 512x512 photo completes in 2  secs aproximately
Asm one is about 5x faster than the C++ code
